  |====                                                                             |   4%
| In this lesson, we'll look at some examples of regression models with more than one
| variable. We'll begin with the Swiss data which we've taken the liberty to load for you.
| This data is part of R's datasets package. It was gathered in 1888, a time of
| demographic change in Switzerland, and measured six quantities in 47 French-speaking
| provinces of Switzerland. We used the code from the slides (the R function pairs) to
| display here a 6 by 6 array of scatterplots showing pairwise relationships between the
| variables. All of the variables, except for fertility, are proportions of population.
| For example, "Examination" shows the percentage of draftees receiving the highest mark
| on an army exam, and "Education" the percentage of draftees with education beyond
| primary school.

...

  |=======                                                                          |   9%
| From the plot, which is NOT one of the factors measured?

1: Infant Mortality
2: Obesity
3: Catholic
4: Fertility

  |===========                                                                      |  13%
| First, use the R function lm to generate the linear model "all" in which Fertility is
| the variable dependent on all the others. Use the R shorthand "." to represent the five
| independent variables in the formula passed to lm.  Remember the data is "swiss".

> all <- lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture+Examination )
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'Fertility' not found
> all <- lm(swiss$Fertility ~ wiss$Agriculture+wiss$Examination )
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'wiss' not found
> all <- lm(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Agriculture+swiss$Examination )

| You're close...I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type "all <- lm(Fertility ~ ., swiss)" at the R prompt.

> all <- lm(Fertility ~ ., swiss)

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |==================                                                               |  22%
| Recall that the Estimates are the coefficients of the independent variables of the
| linear model (all of which are percentages) and they reflect an estimated change in the
| dependent variable (fertility) when the corresponding independent variable changes. So,
| for every 1% increase in percent of males involved in agriculture as an occupation we
| expect a .17 decrease in fertility, holding all the other variables constant; for every
| 1% increase in Catholicism, we expect a .10 increase in fertility, holding all other
| variables constant.

| The interesting point is that the sign of the Agriculture coefficient changed from
| negative (when all the variables were included in the model) to positive (when the model
| only considered Agriculture). Obviously the presence of the other factors affects the
| influence Agriculture has on Fertility.

...

  |===================================                                              |  43%
| Let's consider the relationship between some of the factors. How would you expect level
| Education and performance on an Examination to be related?

1: They would be uncorrelated
2: They would be correlated
3: I would not be able to guess without more information

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |=======================================                                          |  48%
| Now check your intuition with the R command "cor". This computes the correlation between
| Examination and Education.

| The correlation of .6984 shows the two are correlated. Now find the correlation between
| Agriculture and Education.

| The negative correlation (-.6395) between Agriculture and Education might be affecting
| Agriculture's influence on Fertility. I've loaded and sourced the file swissLMs.R in
| your working directory. In it is a function makelms() which generates a sequence of five
| linear models. Each model has one more independent variable than the preceding model, so
| the first has just one independent variable, Agriculture, and the last has all 5. I've
| tried loading the source code in your editor. If I haven't done this, open the file
| manually so you can look at the code.

...

  |=================================================                                |  61%
| Now run the function makelms() to see how the addition of variables affects the
| coefficient of Agriculture in the models.
| Type "makelms()" at the R prompt.
|Notes:       makelms <- function(){
                # Store the coefficient of linear models with different independent variables
                cf <- c(coef(lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture, swiss))[2], 
                        coef(lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture + Catholic,swiss))[2],

| The addition of which variable changes the sign of Agriculture's coefficient from

| You got it right!

  |========================================================                         |  70%
| Now we'll show what happens when we add a variable that provides no new linear
| information to a model. Create a variable ec that is the sum of swiss$Examination and
| swiss$Catholic.

> ec <- sum(swiss$Examination, swiss$Catholic)

| Not quite! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type "ec <- swiss$Examination+swiss$Catholic" at the R prompt.

> ec <- swiss$Examination+swiss$Catholic

| You are really on a roll!

  |============================================================                     |  74%
| Now generate a new model efit with Fertility as the dependent variable and the remaining
| 5 of the original variables AND ec as the independent variables. Use the R shorthand ".
| + ec" for the righthand side of the formula.

> efit <- lm(Fertility~. + ec, swiss)

| You are quite good my friend!

  |===============================================================                  |  78%
| We'll see that R ignores this new term since it doesn't add any information to the
| model.

...

  |===================================================================              |  83%
| Subtract the efit coefficients from the coefficients of the first model you created,
| all.

| You are amazing!

  |======================================================================           |  87%
| Which is the coefficient of ec?

1: I haven't a clue.
2: NA
3: 0

| That's correct!

  |==========================================================================       |  91%
| This tells us that

1: R is really cool
2: Adding ec zeroes out the coefficients
3: Adding ec doesn't change the model
